          Consistently and actively learn and engage with industry professionals to better enhance information systems and eliminate the loop holes that come with advancement of technology. Making systems more efficient in their functions, better programming practises and culture to limit bugs and breakages in software systems and make them easy to use as well as easy to build and customise. to establish and adhere to industry standards to unite and easily synchronise codes across the globe; to create, contribute and be a part of the programing community to digitize everything in the world using technologies available and those of the future to make RESOURCES accessible to EVERYONE ANYWHERE!

        <p>
          Modern cybersecurity, we believe, necessitates a distinct attitude and operational style, particularly for digital organizations with cloud-native operations, such that: Assume compromise, but don't reveal any particular compromise point. You can't safeguard what you can't see, so keep track of everything. The four fundamental activities that comprise these cyber security concepts are as follows; Govern: Recognizing and addressing security threats. Reduce security risks by implementing security controls. Cybersecurity Awareness Training, Cybersecurity Audit, Vulnerability Scanning, and Penetration Testing are the foundations of cybersecurity.

        <h3>:fire:Red & Purple Teaming :red_circle: :purple_square:</h3>
        <p>
          When in doubt, Red Team it. The goal of a Red Team is to take on the role of adversary, or worst-case scenario. It's all about paying attention, not following the rules, and adapting...I take advantage of the fact that there are an infinite number of security vulnerabilities for a given system, program, or strategy, the majority of which will never be discovered, and I combine the blue and red teams into a single team to deliver value to the business. A successful purple team brings together two sets of people who would ordinarily work on opposite sides of the table to work together on a common goal: increasing cybersecurity. This field necessitates creativity, skepticism, and a peculiar sense of humor, all of which are aces up my sleeve!

        <h3> Front-end dev Projects</h3>
        <p>
          I build the front-end of websites and online apps, i.e. the component that people view and interact with. Using web languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to construct websites and applications that people can access and interact with. By ensuring the fundamentals of application design and UI (accessibility, navigation and performance) are applied to all application I build as well as make them scalable and yet Unique unlike nothing you have seen yet. As a web designer i create an application‚Äôs appearance and design; as the front end developer makes sure that the design works online by using coding languages

        <h3> Back-end dev Project</h3>
        <p>
          Server-side development is everything that the users don't see and contains behind-the-scenes activities that occur when performing any action on a website. It focuses primarily on databases, backend logic, APIs, and Servers. The back- end of a web app consists of a server, an application, and a database. As a back-end developer builds and maintains the technology that powers those components which, together, enable the user-facing side of the website to even exist in the first place. use server-side languages like Python, c, c++  and .Net to build an application, and tools like MySQL, Oracle, and SQL Server to find, save, or change data and serve it back to the user in front-end code.
